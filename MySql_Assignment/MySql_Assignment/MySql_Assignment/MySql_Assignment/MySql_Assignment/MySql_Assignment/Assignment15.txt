                                                                                                             Assignment – 15 
                                                                                        Using Subqueries with DML Commands. 
 
1).  Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions as                      Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one customer into         this table. 
      mysql>create table Multicust as
                  select * from salespeople 
                  where snum in (select snum from customers group by snum having count(snum)>1);
       mysql> select * from multicust;

2).  Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders. 
       mysql> delete customers where cnum = any(select cnum from orders
                    where cnum not in(select cnum from customers));
 
3).  Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with              total orders above Rs. 3,000.
         mysql> update salespeople set comm = comm*0.2 
                      where snum in(select snum from orders where amt>3000);
