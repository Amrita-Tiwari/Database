                                                                                                  Assignment â€“ 16 
                                                                                       Creating Tables and Indexes. 
 
1) . Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders                table quickly. 
       mysql>select* from orders;
                  select * from salespeople; 
                  select * from customer;
        mysql > create index ind_orders_odate on orders(odate);
                  desc orders;
2).  If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique          (assume all current values are unique)? 
        
         mysql> create index ind_orders_onum on orders(onum); 
                     desc orders;
3). Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by           date quickly. 
         
          mysql>select * from orders;
                     create index ind_orders_odate on orders(odate);
4).  Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that             this is currently the case. 
        Enter a command that enforces it
        
         mysql>create index ind_customer_rating on customer(rating);
         mysql>desc customer;
